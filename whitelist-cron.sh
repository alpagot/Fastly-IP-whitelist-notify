# Whitelist-cron.sh
# A script which can run as a cron job and notifies if the list
# of Fastly IPs has changed compared to the previous known list.
#
# Stores the list of 'current' IPs in CURRENT_IPS_FILE and uses diff
#Â to see if this has changed.
#
# Make sure to insert an API key in the variable prior to use. Note
# that this is in clear text so this file should be accessible to
# as few people as possible to maintain security
