#
# Whitelist-cron.sh
# A script which can run as a cron job and notifies if the list
# of Fastly IPs has changed compared to the previous known list.
#
# This requires your system to have:
#    curl - a command line web client
#    md5(sum) - a command for calculating and checking sums of files
#    mail(x) - a command line mail/smtp client
#
#
# Stores the list of 'current' IPs in CURRENT_IPS_FILE and uses diff
#Â to see if this has changed.
#
# Make sure to insert an API key in the variable prior to use. Note
# that this is in clear text so this file should be accessible to
# as few people as possible to maintain security
#
# If you have any bugs or issues with this script you can find assitance
# in the fastly community forum at https://community.fastly.com/
#
# If you would like to submit a pull request or patch, please do so at my
# github repository: http://github.com/jondade/IP-whitelist-cron

# Changelog
# 0.0.1
#   J Dade
#   Created first version to start testing.
#   Todo:
#     1: Curl request and diff for changes.
#     2: Mail for noitification of a change.
#     3: Create install function which can add the cron job and 
#         modify the script's options
#     4: Make notification modular / plugable for alternate methods
#
# No user serviceable parts after this point. Any changes are at the
# editors own risk. No support is offered.
#


# This will install the script to the /sbin directory for running.
